  /// but as the **Cb** and **Cr** channels are only sampled on each alternate line in this scheme, the vertical resolution is halved.
  /// The data rate is thus the same.
  /// This fits reasonably well with the PAL color encoding system, since this has only half the vertical chrominance resolution of [NTSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC).
  /// It would also fit extremely well with the [SECAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECAM) color encoding system,
  /// since like that format, 4:2:0 only stores and transmits one color channel per line (the other channel being recovered from the previous line).
  /// However, little equipment has actually been produced that outputs a SECAM analogue video signal.
  /// In general, SECAM territories either have to use a PAL-capable display or a [transcoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding) to convert the PAL signal to SECAM for display.

  /// What if the chroma subsampling model is 4:0:0?
  /// That says to use every pixel of luma data, but that each row has 0 chroma samples applied to it. The resulting image, then, is comprised solely of the luminance dataâ€”a greyscale image.
